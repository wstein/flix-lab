# flix-lab

A small Flix command-line program that greets a name passed on the command
line.

## Usage

```console
flix run                # Hello World!
flix run -- Ada          # Hello, Ada!
flix run -- -h            # prints usage and exits
flix run -- --help        # same as -h
flix run -- --usage       # same as -h
```

| Flag                      | Description                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `-h`, `--help`, `--usage` | Show the usage message and exit. |

Passing an unrecognized option prints an error and the usage message, and
exits with status code 2.

## Datalog + Java interop demo

[src/DatalogYamlDemo.flix](src/DatalogYamlDemo.flix) is a second, independent
entry point (`demo`) that demonstrates:

* Reading a text file with plain Java IO (`java.nio.file.Files`), no
  third-party library.
* Building and populating `java.util.ArrayList`/`java.util.HashMap`
  structures directly from Flix to parse the file.
* [Injecting](https://doc.flix.dev/fixpoints.html#injecting-facts-into-datalog)
  the parsed facts into a Datalog program and querying it.

It reads [resources/people.yaml](resources/people.yaml), a simplified
YAML-like family tree of 74 people across 8 families that all descend from a
shared pair of common ancestors ("Adam" and "Eve"), and computes:

* `Father`/`Mother` -- each person's two parents, taken directly from the file.
* `Ancestor` -- the transitive closure of "has a parent", i.e. every ancestor
  above a person, not just their immediate parents.

Run it with:

```console
flix run --entrypoint demo
```

## Building

```console
flix build
flix test
```
